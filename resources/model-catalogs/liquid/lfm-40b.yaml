description: |-
  Liquid's 40.3B Mixture of Experts (MoE) model. Liquid Foundation Models (LFMs) are large neural networks built with computational units rooted in dynamic systems.

  LFMs are general-purpose AI models that can be used to model any kind of sequential data, including video, audio, text, time series, and signals.

  See the [launch announcement](https://www.liquid.ai/liquid-foundation-models) for benchmarks and more info.
