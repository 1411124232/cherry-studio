  Mistral Small 3 is a 24B-parameter language model optimized for low-latency performance across common AI tasks. Released under the Apache 2.0 license, it features both pre-trained and instruction-tuned versions designed for efficient local deployment.

  The model achieves 81% accuracy on the MMLU benchmark and performs competitively with larger models like Llama 3.3 70B and Qwen 32B, while operating at three times the speed on equivalent hardware. [Read the blog post about the model here.](https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-small-3/)
