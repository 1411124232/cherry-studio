  Note: This model is being deprecated. Recommended replacement is the newer [Ministral 8B](/mistral/ministral-8b)

  This model is currently powered by Mistral-7B-v0.2, and incorporates a "better" fine-tuning than [Mistral 7B](/models/mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1), inspired by community work. It's best used for large batch processing tasks where cost is a significant factor but reasoning capabilities are not crucial.
