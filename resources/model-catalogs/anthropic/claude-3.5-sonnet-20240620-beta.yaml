  Claude 3.5 Sonnet delivers better-than-Opus capabilities, faster-than-Sonnet speeds, at the same Sonnet prices. Sonnet is particularly good at:

  - Coding: Autonomously writes, edits, and runs code with reasoning and troubleshooting
  - Data science: Augments human data science expertise; navigates unstructured data while using multiple tools for insights
  - Visual processing: excelling at interpreting charts, graphs, and images, accurately transcribing text to derive insights beyond just the text alone
  - Agentic tasks: exceptional tool use, making it great at agentic tasks (i.e. complex, multi-step problem solving tasks that require engaging with other systems)
