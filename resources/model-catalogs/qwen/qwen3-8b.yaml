description: Qwen3-8B is a dense 8.2B parameter causal language model from the Qwen3 series, designed for both reasoning-heavy tasks and efficient dialogue. It supports seamless switching between "thinking" mode for math, coding, and logical inference, and "non-thinking" mode for general conversation. The model is fine-tuned for instruction-following, agent integration, creative writing, and multilingual use across 100+ languages and dialects. It natively supports a 32K token context window and can extend to 131K tokens with YaRN scaling.
