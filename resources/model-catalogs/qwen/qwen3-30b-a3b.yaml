  Qwen3, the latest generation in the Qwen large language model series, features both dense and mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures to excel in reasoning, multilingual support, and advanced agent tasks. Its unique ability to switch seamlessly between a thinking mode for complex reasoning and a non-thinking mode for efficient dialogue ensures versatile, high-quality performance.

  Significantly outperforming prior models like QwQ and Qwen2.5, Qwen3 delivers superior mathematics, coding, commonsense reasoning, creative writing, and interactive dialogue capabilities. The Qwen3-30B-A3B variant includes 30.5 billion parameters (3.3 billion activated), 48 layers, 128 experts (8 activated per task), and supports up to 131K token contexts with YaRN, setting a new standard among open-source models.
