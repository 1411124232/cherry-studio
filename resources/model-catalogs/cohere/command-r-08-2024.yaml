  command-r-08-2024 is an update of the [Command R](/models/cohere/command-r) with improved performance for multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and tool use. More broadly, it is better at math, code and reasoning and is competitive with the previous version of the larger Command R+ model.
