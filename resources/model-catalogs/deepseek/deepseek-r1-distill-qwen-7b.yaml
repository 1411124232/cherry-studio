description: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B is a 7 billion parameter dense language model distilled from DeepSeek-R1, leveraging reinforcement learning-enhanced reasoning data generated by DeepSeek's larger models. The distillation process transfers advanced reasoning, math, and code capabilities into a smaller, more efficient model architecture based on Qwen2.5-Math-7B. This model demonstrates strong performance across mathematical benchmarks (92.8% pass@1 on MATH-500), coding tasks (Codeforces rating 1189), and general reasoning (49.1% pass@1 on GPQA Diamond), achieving competitive accuracy relative to larger models while maintaining smaller inference costs.
