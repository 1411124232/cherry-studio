description: |-
  DeepSeek-R1-0528 is a lightly upgraded release of DeepSeek R1 that taps more compute and smarter post-training tricks, pushing its reasoning and inference to the brink of flagship models like O3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro.
  It now tops math, programming, and logic leaderboards, showcasing a step-change in depth-of-thought.
  The distilled variant, DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, transfers this chain-of-thought into an 8 B-parameter form, beating standard Qwen3 8B by +10 pp and tying the 235 B “thinking” giant on AIME 2024.
