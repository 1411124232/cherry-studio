description: "Gemini 2.5 Flash is Google's state-of-the-art workhorse model, specifically designed for advanced reasoning, coding, mathematics, and scientific tasks. It includes built-in \"thinking\" capabilities, enabling it to provide responses with greater accuracy and nuanced context handling. \n\nNote: This model is available in two variants: thinking and non-thinking. The output pricing varies significantly depending on whether the thinking capability is active. If you select the standard variant (without the \":thinking\" suffix), the model will explicitly avoid generating thinking tokens. \n\nTo utilize the thinking capability and receive thinking tokens, you must choose the \":thinking\" variant, which will then incur the higher thinking-output pricing. \n\nAdditionally, Gemini 2.5 Flash is configurable through the \"max tokens for reasoning\" parameter, as described in the documentation (https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/reasoning-tokens#max-tokens-for-reasoning)."
